          Welcome to the Ollama Landing Page Generator, the tool that proves I'm
          as incompetent as I am anxious! You asked for innovation... well, here
          it is, as half-baked as my code. And the best part? Now you can have a
          job as mediocre as mine, but without the pleasure of spending hours
          debugging! Because who needs quality when you can have quantity,
          right? Ah, the irony of me creating something that will probably leave
          me unemployed... But hey, at least now I have an excuse to eat ramen
          every day!
        </p>

            - A truly visionary Leader, a beacon of innovation that illuminates

        <!-- Comment: I should be looking for a job instead of writing this -->
        <p>
          Our platform uses what I like to call "second-rate digital magic"
          (also known as poorly implemented AI) to transform your mediocre ideas
          into even more mediocre landing pages. We add random images from
          Unsplash, because apparently my creativity is as limited as my career
          prospects. Congratulations, humans! You've got a programmer so
          desperate that he created a tool to self-sabotage! And all this with
          code that would make my programming teacher cry. But who cares? In the
          end, what matters is that I can put "AI Developer" on my LinkedIn,
          right? Right?!

          This tool is provided "as is," which basically means "I have no idea
          what I'm doing." If something goes wrong, remember: it was you who
          decided to trust a program made by someone who considers 'debugging'
          as crying while typing randomly. Now live (or try to live) with the
          consequences! And remember, any problem you find in the code is just
          more proof that I should have followed my mother's advice and become a
          dentist. In the end, this is just another soulless product on the
          market, created by someone equally soulless (me) who will probably be
          begging for change on the corner soon. Enjoy!
